## Abstract

We develop an Android application “Flying Dictionary” which is an offline pop-up dictionary meant to ease users by displaying the meaning of the words they find tough without having to switch to some other app in order to look for its meaning. The application was created and uploaded on Play Store in March 2017, and since then over 5000 users have installed it on their Android devices. With a current rating of 4.8 (as of May 2018), our aim is to make it easier for otherwise reluctant students to encourage learning new words with ease and at the click of a button. This paper analyses the impact of using the application for daily look-up of meanings, on users’ learning experience. The analysis indicates that providing the users with the ability to glance the meanings on the go helps them in learning more new words and prevents them from giving excuses like the need for an online connection or the need for switching the app in order to look for the meaning. This contributes to the growing importance of the pop-up feature and emphasizes the need to incorporate this in the popular dictionary apps as well as try and bring up the feature as a built-in utility in the Android OS itself.
